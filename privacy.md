# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how **music-stream-match** ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our website at [api.music-stream-match.space](https://api.music-stream-match.space) and our API.

## What We Collect

### Website (HTML Pages)

Our website uses **Google Analytics** (measurement ID: `G-ZFZJ9E2Q9D`) to understand how visitors interact with the site. Google Analytics may collect:

- **Usage data** — pages visited, time spent, referral source
- **Device information** — browser type, operating system, screen resolution
- **Approximate location** — derived from IP address (city/country level)
- **Cookies** — Google Analytics uses cookies to distinguish unique visitors

Google processes this data on our behalf. For details on how Google handles data, see [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [How Google Uses Data](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

### API (Static JSON Files)

The API is served as static files via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We do **not** run any application server and do **not** collect, log, or process any data from API requests.

GitHub Pages may collect standard technical information (such as IP addresses) as part of hosting. This is governed by [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

**Google Analytics is not used on API endpoints** — it only runs on the HTML documentation pages.

## Cookies

The only cookies used on this site are those set by **Google Analytics** for visitor analytics on the HTML pages. No session cookies, authentication cookies, or preference cookies are used.

You can opt out of Google Analytics by:
- Using the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)
- Disabling cookies in your browser settings
- Using browser extensions that block tracking scripts
